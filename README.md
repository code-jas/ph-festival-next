Ph Festival is my first web application project from college. I designed it using Figma to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The goal was to showcase Philippine festivals with a focus on aesthetics and user experience.

This application offers a comprehensive exploration of annual festivals in the Philippines, featuring vibrant galleries, timelines, detailed festival pages, and interactive search and filter options for an enhanced user experience.

### Key Features

-  **Cultural Showcase**: Provides in-depth insights into the history, significance, and evolution of various festivals.
-  **Dynamic Visuals**: Utilizes an image slider and vibrant galleries to bring festivals to life.
-  **User Engagement**: Enhances the experience with detailed descriptions, multimedia content, and interactive elements.
-  **Interactive Exploration**: Enables users to discover festivals by region, date, and cultural importance.
-  **Responsive Design**: Ensures an optimized experience across all devices.
